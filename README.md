#jQuerySf 2015: Generative Art Submissions

 We are quite aware that the web communtiy is made of some of the most creative individuals on the planet. As part of the conference we will be curating a gallery of generative art that will be on display during the entire conference.

 We are looking for static prints, generative displays, interactive installations, and any other ways in which you can think of harnessing the power of web technology to create a unique and engaging experience.

 More details about the application process to come soon.  In the mean time feel free to start an issue to discuss ideas.

If you have ideas you would like to contribute and don't want to take part in the public form please feel free to email [jquerysf@famo.us](mailto:jquerysf@famo.us)
